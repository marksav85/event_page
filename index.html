					My Day Off!
				</h1>
				<p>
					My day off involves a fun packed day of doing nothing! No work, no stress,
					and a lot of netflix. Whether it is laying on the sofa for hours on end,
					scrolling through my phone for no reason, being too lazy to cook so
					constantly snacking, or avoiding chores or effort of any kind, my day
					off has everything needed for frustration and regret the day after!
					<br>
					<br>
					Check out some of the highlights!

						<h3>
							Running out of coffee!
						</h3>

						<p>
							Desperate for another cup of coffee and realising I need to go to
							the shop because I have run out, I instead sulk for the rest of
							afternoon at how unfair life is.

						<h3>
							Breakfast
						</h3>

						<p>
							After finally deciding what I want for breakfast, I power myself
							to the kitchen to start the laborious task of cooking only to find
							I don't have the main ingredient: eggs! Should've gone to the shop.

						<h3>
							Time for Wine
						</h3>

						<p>
							Finally time for an evening glass/bottle of red wine! How I've been
							looking forward to this after doing nothing all day. I deserve
							to treat myself. And..... there's no wine left. Another reason I
							should have gone to the shop.
